			<h3>Personal:</h3>
				<p>In the next 10 years, my objective is to become an accomplished artist, refining and expanding my artistic skills. My focus will be to create artwork for my family intended to enrich their lives for generations to come. My artistic passions include drawing, painting, sculpting, and photography, though this is not where they end. I wish to enrich myself and experiment with and learn many different types of artistic mediums, perhaps even create styles of my own. This personal goal aligns with many of my values. Life-long learning is a core value, and I will explore and experiment with new techniques and artistic mediums. Additionally, it aligns with my value for family, as I aspire to not only inspire them, but also create artworks that touch their hearts, leaving behind a legacy that can be passed down through generations. My aspirations for this goal are very personal. Public recognition is not my driving force, but instead I aspire to explore new artistic mediums and create meaningful artworks filled with emotional expression, and to capture and document my life.</p>
				<p>The impact I wish to make is to inspire my family to embrace their own creativity and to cherish the time we all have together. With my art, I want to create tangible reminders of our relationships and to always remind them of how important they are to me. I want the artwork to serve as comforting pieces they can immerse themselves in throughout the different stages of life. This journey will also provide fulfillment with personal growth, as I will be able to gain insights into myself and emotions. The fulfillment will also come when emotional connections are strengthened through the artwork.</p>
